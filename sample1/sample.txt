Note that applications should define a main() method instead of extending scala.App. Subclasses of scala.App may not work correctly.

This program just counts the number of lines containing ‘a’ and the number containing ‘b’ in the Spark README. Note that you’ll need to replace YOUR_SPARK_HOME with the location where Spark is installed. Unlike the earlier examples with the Spark shell, which initializes its own SparkSession, we initialize a SparkSession as part of the program.

We call SparkSession.builder to construct a [[SparkSession]], then set the application name, and finally call getOrCreate to get the [[SparkSession]] instance.

Our application depends on the Spark API, so we’ll also include an sbt configuration file, build.sbt, which explains that Spark is a dependency. This file also adds a repository that Spark depends on:
